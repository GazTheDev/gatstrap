Hi guys.

Welcome to my new blog. I am going to write mostly about History on this. As you can tell the site is basic but It is intended for the purpose of reading only and a blog. I will include a list of sources for each article at the bottom of the article. After each article I will post a random fact! 

So who am I?  My name is Gareth. I am a 19 year old enthusastic retail worker by day and by night a history geek. I gained a GCSE in History, however I did not pursue it further due to course offerings at college!. 

Of course I am obessed with it. I love researching about events in History. One of my strengths is Jack The Ripper and have had the privige of going on the walk around Whitechapel to see the murder sites. I grew up in a small town called Braintree, Essex. As a small town the history is emense. However I must admit I don't look indepth into the history behind the town, maybe a research project. 

I already hasve a few articles already planned, at the moment I am reading a book called "Cover Up" once I finish it I will write about some of the more unknown theories. 

Hopefully you are going to enjoy some of the content I will be putting out. I'm not the best at writing or using high level English and I must warn you, there is errors once In a while. 

Have a awesome day
